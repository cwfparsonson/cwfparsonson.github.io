Wavelength routed optical switching promises low power and latency networking
for data centres, but requires a wideband wavelength tuneable source (WTS)
capable of sub-nanosecond switching at every node. We propose a hybrid WTS that
uses time-interleaved tuneable lasers, each gated by a semiconductor optical
amplifier, where the performance of each device is optimised using artificial
intelligence. Through simulation and experiment we demonstrate record
wavelength switch times below 900 ps across 6.05 THz (122Ã—50 GHz) of
continuously tuneable optical bandwidth. A method for further bandwidth scaling
is evaluated and compared to alternative designs.
