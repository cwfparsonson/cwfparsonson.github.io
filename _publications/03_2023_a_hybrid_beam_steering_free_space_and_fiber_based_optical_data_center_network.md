Wireless data center networks (DCNs) are promising solutions to mitigate the
cabling complexity in traditional wired DCNs and potentially reduce the
end-to-end latency with faster propagation speed in free space. Yet, physical
architectures in wireless DCNs must be carefully designed regarding wireless
link blockage, obstacle bypassing, path loss, interference and spatial
efficiency in a dense deployment. This paper presents the physical layer design
of a hybrid FSO/in-fiber DCN while guaranteeing an all-optical, single hop,
non-oversubscribed and full-bisection bandwidth network. We propose two layouts
and analyze their scalability: (1) A static network utilizing only tunable
sources which can scale up to 43 racks, 15,609 nodes and 15,609 channels;
and (2) a re-configurable network with both tunable sources and piezoelectric
actuator (PZT) based beam-steering which can scale up to 8 racks, 2,904
nodes and 185,856 channels at millisecond PZT switching time.
Based on a traffic generation framework and a dynamic
wavelength-timeslot scheduling algorithm, the system-level network performance
is simulated for a 363-node subnet, reaching >99% throughput and
1.23$ us average scheduler latency at 90% load.
