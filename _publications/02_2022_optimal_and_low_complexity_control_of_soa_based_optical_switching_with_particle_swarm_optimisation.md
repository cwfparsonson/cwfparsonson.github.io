<div style="text-align: justify"> 
We propose a reliable, low-complexity particle swarm optimisation (PSO)
approach to control semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)-based switches. We
experimentally demonstrate less than 610 ps off-on switching (settling) time
and less than 2.2% overshoot with 20x lower sampling rate and 8x reduced DAC
resolution.
