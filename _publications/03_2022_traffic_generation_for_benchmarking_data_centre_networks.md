Benchmarking is commonly used in research fields, such as computer architecture
design and machine learning, as a powerful paradigm for rigorously assessing,
comparing, and developing novel technologies. However, the data centre network
(DCN) community lacks a standard open-access and reproducible traffic
generation framework for benchmark workload generation. Driving factors behind
this include the proprietary nature of traffic traces, the limited detail and
quantity of open-access network-level data sets, the high cost of real world
experimentation, and the poor reproducibility and fidelity of synthetically
generated traffic. This is curtailing the community's understanding of existing
systems and hindering the ability with which novel technologies, such as
optical DCNs, can be developed, compared, and tested.

We present TrafPy; an open-access framework for generating both realistic and
custom DCN traffic traces. TrafPy is compatible with any simulation, emulation,
or experimentation environment, and can be used for standardised benchmarking
and for investigating the properties and limitations of network systems such as
schedulers, switches, routers, and resource managers. We give an overview of
the TrafPy traffic generation framework, and provide a brief demonstration of
its efficacy through an investigation into the sensitivity of some canonical
scheduling algorithms to varying traffic trace characteristics in the context
of optical DCNs. TrafPy is open-sourced via GitHub and all data associated with
this manuscript via RDR.
