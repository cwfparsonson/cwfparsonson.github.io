Optical  switching promises  low  power  and  latency networking for data centres, but requires a wideband,  ultra-fast wavelength-tuneable source (WTS) at every node.  We propose a hybrid WTS that  uses  two  time-interleaved  tuneable  lasers, each  gated  by  a  semiconductor  optical  amplifier, where the performance of each device is optimised using artificial intelligence algorithms.  We experimentally demonstrate a switching bandwidth of 6.05 THz (122Ã—50 GHz) with stable switch times of 547 ps.  The hybrid WTS scales well with respect to on-chip area and power consumption, and therefore  constitutes  the  first  demonstration  of  truly scalable ultra-fast optical switching.
