   -I am a communication networks Ph.D. student. My research is focused on improving 
   -resource allocation in data centre networks. I am interested in 
   -using machine learning and optimisation algorithms to improve optical data centre
   -networks to the point where they have vastly superior scalability, bandwidth, 
   -latency and power consumption relative to their electronic counterparts. 
   -Specifically, I am working on: (1) Using machine learning for combinatorial 
   -optimisation over large graphs applied to resource allocation and scheduling 
   -in optical data centres; (2) optimisation algorithms applied to ultra-fast optical 
   -switching.

I have 5+ years experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
communication network research and development. I have a proven track record
developing state-of-the-art algorithms, open-sourcing high-quality research
code, and publishing, reviewing, and winning awards in top outlets such as
AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, JLT, and OFC. I have conceptualised and deployed multiple
novel algorithmic solutions to real-world problems.

  Currently, I am finishing a PhD in communication networks, artificial
intelligence, and optimisation. My research is focused on solving NP-hard
discrete optimisation problems with the use of reinforcement learning, graph
neural networks, swarm, and evolutionary algorithms. My specific research
interests include: (1) machine learning for combinatorial optimisation over
graphs; (2) resource allocation in optical data centre networks and distributed
deep learning clusters; (3) optimisation algorithms applied to ultra-fast
optical switching; and (4) developing open source tools for benchmarking.
