I am a communication networks Ph.D. student. My research is focused on improving 
resource allocation in computer networks. In particular, I am interested in

networks to the point where they have vastly superior scalability, bandwidth,

Specifically, I am working on: (1) Using machine learning for combinatorial 
optimisation over large graphs applied to resource allocation 
in optical data centre networks and distributed deep learning clusters; 
(2) optimisation algorithms applied to ultra-fast optical switching; and (3) benchmarking.
