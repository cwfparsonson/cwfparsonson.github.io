<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a Ph.D. student working on communication networks, machine learning, and
optimisation.  My research is focused on solving NP-hard discrete optimisation
problems with AI, particularly with the use of reinforcement learning and graph
neural networks. My specific research interests include: (1) Machine learning
for combinatorial optimisation over graphs; (2) resource allocation in optical
data centre networks and distributed deep learning clusters; (3) optimisation
algorithms applied to ultra-fast optical switching; and (4) benchmarking.
