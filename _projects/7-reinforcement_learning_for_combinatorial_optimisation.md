title: "Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimisation"
excerpt: "([Paper One](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14105)) ([Paper Two](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14345?context=cs)) ([GitHub](https://github.com/cwfparsonson/retro_branching)) Optimisation problems are search problems where a solution which maximises some objective is being sought amongst a search space. Combinatorial optimisation (CO) is an optimisation sub-category where the solution being sought is a discrete variable (e.g. an integer, a graph, a set, etc.) amongst a finite (or countably infinite) space of possible solutions. Many real-world problems fall under the broad category of CO, from network routing and scheduling to protein folding and fundamental science. However, with many CO problems being NP-hard, solving non-trivial instance sizes in reasonable time frames is a significant challenge. Although CO solvers were studied and designed extensively in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup>, recent years have seen a resurgance in their academic study with the application of machine learning to solving CO problems. This work saw the application of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn to solve graph-based combinatorial optimisation problems from scratch. This was done through the design of two new machine learning algorithms. The first achieved state-of-the-art scalability for learned heuristic solutions, and the second enabled the integration of reinforcement learning into exact branch-and-bound solvers. These are important steps towards establishing machine learning as the go-to approach for solving CO problems, which will unlock advances in a plethora of real-world applications.  <br/><img src='/images/projects/reinforcement_learning_for_combinatorial_optimisation/retrospective_trajectories_3.png'>"
