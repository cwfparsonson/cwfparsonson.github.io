title: "Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimisation"
excerpt: "(*Two papers under peer review*) Optimisation problems are search problems where a solution is being sought from amongst some search space which maximises an objective. Combinatorial optimisation (CO) is sub-category of optimisation problems where the solution being sought is a discrete variable (e.g. an integer, a graph, a set, etc.) amongst a finite (or countably infinite) space of possible solutions. Many real-world problems fall under the broad category of CO, from network routing and scheduling to protein folding and fundamental science. However, with many CO problems turning out to be NP-hard, solving non-trivial instance sizes in reasonable time frames is a significant challenge. Although CO solvers were studied and designed extensively in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup>, recent years have seen a surge in the application of machine learning to solving CO problems. This work saw the application of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn to solve graph-based combinatorial optimisation problems from scratch. This was done through the design of new machine learning algorithms. The first achieved state-of-the-art scalability, and the second enabled the integration of reinforcement learning into exact branch-and-bound solvers. These are important steps towards establishing machine learning as the go-to CO solver method, which will unlock advances in a plethora of real-world applications.  <br/><img src='/images/projects/reinforcement_learning_for_combinatorial_optimisation/retrospective_trajectories_3.png'>"
