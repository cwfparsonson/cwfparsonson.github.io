title: "Resource Management in Distributed Deep Learning Optical Clusters (Ongoing)"
excerpt: "([GitHub](https://github.com/cwfparsonson/ddls)) Low-latency, high-bandwidth, ultra-scalable optical circuit switched networks can address the limitations of current compute clusters and enable the deployment of next-generation high-performance clusters and data centres. In particular, machine learning workloads present a unique opportunity for which to develop specialised circuit-based clusters because they are predictable, periodic, and consist mostly of large network flows. Furthermore, trillion-parameter learning models are being developed with final test performances capped primarily by the model size; a characteristic which, in the 'strong scaling' case, is limited by the bandwidth of the network connecting the cluster's servers. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of how to make resource management decisions (from computation graph partitioning and placement to server allocation and scheduling) when training massive models on an optical cluster with distributed deep learning. By framing the problem as a Markov decision process where sequential actions must be taken to maximise some reward (such as minimising the overall job completion time), a graph neural network can be trained from scratch with end-to-end reinforcement learning to allocate the cluster's resources near-optimally. We are in the process of developing a suite of cluster environments, graph neural network models, and reinforcement learning algorithms in order to achieve this, and we hope to demonstrate both good performance and the ability to scale to large networks and jobs.

The servers of traditional computer clusters are interconencted by electronic packet switched networks. Such 'electronic networks' have poor scalability, bandwidth, latency, and power consumption. Data centres now consume 2% of the World's electricity, and the slowing of Moore's Law coinciding with new data-hungry demands means electronic switches are unable to keep up with emerging data-heavy applications such as machine learning, genome processing, and the internet-of-things. As such, although server compute power has had a 65x increase over the last 18 years, the bandwidth of the network facilitating communication between these servers has only increased by 4.8x, resulting in an 8-factor decrease in bytes communicated per flop. This shifts the performance bottleneck away from the servers themselves and into the network connecting them.

In this work, we aim to address the challenge of how to make resource management decisions (from computation graph partitioning and placement to server allocation and scheduling) for training massive models on an optical cluster with distributed deep learning. By framing the problem as a Markov decision process where sequential actions must be taken to maximise some reward (such as minimise the overall job completion time), a graph neural network can be trained in an end-to-end fashion to reason about how to allocate the cluster's resources optimally. We are in the process of developing a suite of cluster environments, graph neural network models, and reinforcement learning algorithms in order to achieve this, and we hope to demonstrate both good performance and the ability to scale to large networks and jobs.
