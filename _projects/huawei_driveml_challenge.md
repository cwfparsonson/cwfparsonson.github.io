title: "Huawei DriveML Challenge"
excerpt: "Autonomous driving holds the promise of reducing traffic accidents by designing safe, robust, accurate and intelligent agents. In this introductory-level competition, Huawei open-accessed their traffic perception simulation system with which competitors had 6 weeks to design, train and test a single-agent navigating roads and traffic. My team attempted to use the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) genetic algorithm for the agent policy trained with a reinforcement learning framework, however performance was ultimately not good due to poor generalisation to unseen scenarios.<br/><img src='/images/projects/huawei_driveml_challenge/excerpt.png'>"
