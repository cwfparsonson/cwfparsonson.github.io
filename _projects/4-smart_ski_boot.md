title: "Smart Ski Boot"
excerpt: "Using embedded systems hardware can be more complex to programme, but can bring benefits in terms of costs and power consumption. This project saw the development of a prototype 'smart ski boot' that could be used for more accurate, in-depth and cheap ski technique instruction than is deliverable by expensive human instructors, who typically charge Â£500-700 a day. This stands to benefit not only skiers who will save money in tuition fees and receive superior teaching, but also the ski industry, from restauranteurs to equipment providers, whose customer base will increase as fewer people are priced out of the sport.<br/><img src='/images/projects/smart_ski_boot/excerpt.png'>"
