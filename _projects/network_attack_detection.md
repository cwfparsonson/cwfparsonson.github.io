title: "Network Attack Detection"
excerpt: "Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorised users, including perhaps insiders. The KDD dataset from the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program competition contains roughly 5 million network connection request fingerprints split into 4 broad categories (DoS, R2L, U2R and probing attacks) which can be further sub-divided into 23 forms of attack. Using a standard sequential neural network with 3 hidden layers, a model was trained with a supervised learning framework in a client-server architecture to detect melicious network requests with 99.99% accuracy.<br/><img src='/images/projects/network_attack_detection/excerpt.png'>"
