title: "Ultra-Fast Optical Switch Optimisation"
excerpt: "One of the primary bottlenecks to all-optical data centre networks is the lack of a packet-timescale switch. This project saw the application of AI techniques to switch semiconductor optical amplifiers in just half a nanosecond. AI beat the previous world-record by an order of magnitude and, for the first time, offered the potential to be scaled to thousands of switches in a real data centre.<br/><img src='/images/projects/ultrafast_optical_switch_optimisation/excerpt.png'>"
